# Medilab WordPress Theme Conversion

This is a practice project where I converted the **Medilab** Bootstrap template into a dynamic WordPress theme. The goal of this project is to learn and apply theme development concepts, use modern WordPress tools, and build a fully functional theme for my portfolio.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Content:** Integrated with **ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)** to manage content dynamically.
- **Theme Customizer:** Implemented using the **WordPress Customizer API** to manage global theme settings.
- **Required Plugins:** Uses **TGM Plugin Activation** to manage and require essential plugins.
- **ACF JSON Support:** Stores and loads ACF field groups from a JSON file for portability.
- **Responsive Design:** Based on the **Bootstrap framework** for mobile-first, responsive layouts.
- **Clean Code & Structure:** Organized code with clear folder structures for easy maintenance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- WordPress
- ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)
- WordPress Customizer API
- TGM Plugin Activation
- Contact Form 7
- Bootstrap
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

## 📂 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UsamaZiaDev/medilab-wp-conversion.git
   ```
2. Copy the folder to your WordPress **themes** directory.
3. Activate the theme from the WordPress **admin panel**.
4. Install required plugins using **TGM Plugin Activation**:
   - Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
   - Contact Form 7
5. Ensure that ACF is activated, as the theme uses **ACF JSON** for custom fields.
6. Import the required content or add new posts/pages.

## 🎨 Theme Customizer Integration
This theme utilizes the **WordPress Customizer API** to allow users to manage global theme settings easily. The customizer settings include:

- **Logo & Site Identity**: Upload custom logos, change site title, and description.
- **Colors & Typography**: Modify global colors and fonts.
- **Header & Footer Settings**: Customize header and footer elements.
- **Layout Options**: Adjust container width, sidebar positions, and more.
- **Custom CSS**: Add custom CSS directly from the Customizer.

## 📂 ACF JSON Usage
This theme includes an **acf-json** folder inside the theme directory. This feature allows ACF to automatically load field groups without requiring manual import.

- **Location:** `wp-content/themes/medilab-wp-conversion/acf-json/`
- **How It Works:**
  - ACF automatically scans this folder for JSON files and loads the custom fields.
  - Any changes made in ACF will be saved in this folder, ensuring portability across installations.
  - No need to manually import/export field groups in the ACF settings.
